# ML-LogisticRegression
# Logistic Regression Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression** using Python. It includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## Features Implemented:
- **Handling Null Values:**
  - Numerical columns: Replaced with mean or median.
  - Categorical columns: Replaced with mode.
- **Feature Scaling** to normalize data.
- **Label Encoding** to convert categorical data into numerical form.
- **Logistic Regression Model Training and Evaluation.**

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model training)

## Dataset:
The project uses 'bank-additional-full_final.csv` for training the model.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the 'LogicReg.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Upload the 'bank-additional-full_final.csv` file.
4. Execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess data and train the model.

## Result:
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **Accuracy and Confusion Matrix**

## Why this Project?
- **Fundamental Machine Learning Concept** – Logistic regression is a fundamental ML algorithm used for classification problems.
- **Real-World Applications** – It is widely applied in **medical diagnosis, spam detection, customer churn prediction**, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing Experience** – This project covers handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling, which are essential skills in data science.
- **Model Evaluation** – Learning to evaluate classification models using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score helps in understanding model effectiveness.
